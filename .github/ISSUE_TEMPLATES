**As a** Final year Information Technology student working on the 'Efficient Water Management' project
**I need** to build a real-time, voice-controlled irrigation system using IoT (ESP8266) and Firebase integration 
**So that** farmers can automate irrigation, receive real-time soil data, and reduce water wastage through a user-friendly Android app
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * Microcontroller: ESP8266 NodeMCU

Sensors:

Soil Moisture Sensor (capacitive or resistive type)

DHT11/DHT22 for temperature and humidity

Actuator: Relay Module to control water pump

Power Supply: 5V regulated supply (power bank or adapter)

Connectivity: Wi-Fi (ESP8266 connects to Firebase via internet)

Backend: Firebase Realtime Database

Mobile App: Developed in Android Studio, includes:

Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In)

Realtime data monitoring

Voice control using Google Speech Recognition API

Manual and auto irrigation modes

Cloud Functions (Optional): Firebase Functions for notification triggers

Thresholds: Predefined soil moisture values (e.g., below 30% â†’ needs watering)   

### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Feature: Smart Irrigation Monitoring System

Scenario: Real-time soil monitoring and irrigation alert
Given the ESP8266 is powered and connected to Wi-Fi
And soil moisture is below 30%
When data is uploaded to Firebase
Then the app should notify the user with an irrigation alert

Scenario: Voice-based irrigation control
Given the user opens the Android app
And says the voice command "Start irrigation"
When the voice is processed using Google Speech API
Then Firebase sends a signal to the ESP8266 to activate the relay module
And the water pump is turned on

Scenario: Auto-stop irrigation when soil moisture is sufficient
Given the water pump is ON
When the soil moisture sensor detects a level above 60%
Then the ESP8266 should deactivate the relay
And the app should display "Irrigation Complete" message
